# python_keylogger

The project consists in a simple python keylogger

The keylogger uses Python keyoboard module to detect all pressed keys and temporarly saves them
in a global variable. The keylogger than proceeds to periodically save .txt logs of the recorded
activity in some log files. 

Log files will be saved in the same directory of keylogger.py
